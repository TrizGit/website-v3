        Sooo... i made a community post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YT_TrizGame/community">here</a>.<br>I really wanted to record while i'm at home and edit while at school/boarding (since i'm probably only at school for ~2 weeks). I need FNF content though, i can't just do only roblox content. Could you atleast fill this form for me?

    <h2 class="side-margins">Welcome | Fri, 21 Feb 2025</h2>
    <p class="side-margins">
        Welcome to my coded website. This is the second website i have, after the Google Sites.<br><br>
        Now, why did i decide to migrate this coded website from Glitch?<br>
        Two reasons:<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>It needs to be online.<br>Since the wifi here in my school kinda sucks, and always turns off at a specific time, i need to find a way to edit offline. Glitch needs to be online, whereas GitHub i can just edit locally in my laptop, and when i need to publish it i'll just be online and press "Commit changes...".</li>
            <li>There are no autocomplete.<br>I struggle to type because of my "kinda broken" keyboard. Because i can just edit offline using VS Code, it has an autocomplete thing that reduces my mouse movement to keys in the On-Screen Keyboard</li>
        </ul><br>
        <div class="side-margins">
            Glitch is still great though. I suggest using it as a base, since if you don't know how to use GitHub, then you're going to struggle like me.<br>I deleted around 5 repos because of the messy commit names lmao.
