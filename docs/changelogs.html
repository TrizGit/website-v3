        - A test build that i'm clearly not proud of.
        - Took 15 commits before making this page.
        - Do you know why i say "migration" on the commits? Because this was a redesign from Glitch.
        - Remember that i keep trying to make the header and footer cover the whole top and bottom, removing those disgusting side lines if you can see it.
        - This is not even the whole redesign, some pages are missing. Go on, try the "News" button down there and see it yourself.
        - I don't even know why i made a rant in this page.
