# Triz Unofficial Web v3
If you're seeing this, you're a loser haha. (just kidding)  
Anyway view the website [here](https://bit.ly/trizgame-website-v3).<!-- yes i'm using the bit.ly link -->

## How it all started
I came across a video talking about how to make a website on GitHub.
I've tried in the past, but failed... like 5 times or more i don't know.

## Why did i make this?
1. I need to learn to code other than Python.
2. I need to learn to use GitHub and VS Code too.

These are it... for now...
