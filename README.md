# Triz Unofficial Web v3
If you're seeing this, you're a loser haha. 

Anyway view the website [here](https://bit.ly/trizgame-website-v3).<!-- yes i'm using the bit.ly link -->
## How it all started
I came across a video talking about how to make a website on GitHub.
I've tried in the past, but failed... like 5 times or more i don't know.
## The difference between this, Google Sites, and Glitch (my old coded website)
| On... | GitHub | Google Sites | Glitch |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Difficulty | Hard | Easy | Hard |
| Restriction | None | Google-owned apps | None |
| Offline Editing? | Yes | No | No |
| Confusing Scale | 8/10 | 3/10 | 5/10 |

Yes, just these i want to mention lmao.

## Why did i make this?
1. I need to learn to code other than Python.
2. I need to learn to use GitHub and VS Code too.

These are it... for now...
